                I am a third-year student at Indiana University majoring in computer science. I have a passion for collaborating with others and developing my critical thinking and problem-solving skills. I have demonstrated these strengths in a variety of positions, beginning when I was younger, where I learned to work with others through playing soccer.

                Now, at Indiana University, I continue to seek new opportunities to expand my skills and professionalism. I work to advance my knowledge by expanding my leadership skills. I am currently the captain of a little 500 cycling team and plan on competing in the spring semester.

                In the future, I hope to advance my development and increase my strengths in communication, collaboration, and problem-solving. I intend on working to get an internship for the 2024 summer
